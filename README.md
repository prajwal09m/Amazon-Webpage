# Amazon-Webpage
This project is a simplified Amazon-style checkout page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view, update, and remove items from their shopping cart dynamically. The design and functionality simulate the final step of an e-commerce transaction, focusing on the user experience during the checkout process.

This project includes multiple images attached. To start off, Please open the "amazon-webpage.html"

Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, localStorage)

How it works:
Users get to choose from a list of products, with style replicating the real Amazon webpage.
They "get" to choose how many items they want and can tweak with the numbers.

Personal note:
This was one of my first full UI builds â€” a small step towards building knowledge on front-end tasks.
