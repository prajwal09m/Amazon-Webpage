# Amazon-Webpage
This project is a simplified Amazon-style checkout page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view, update, and remove items from their shopping cart dynamically. The design and functionality simulate the final step of an e-commerce transaction, focusing on the user experience during the checkout process.
